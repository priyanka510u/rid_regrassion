Ridge Regression Project

#Overview

This repository demonstrates the application of Ridge Regression, a machine learning technique used to address multicollinearity by adding a regularization term to the model. Ridge Regression helps improve prediction accuracy by penalizing large coefficients, thus making the model more robust.
